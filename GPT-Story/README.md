## Story:

**This is my Story with GPT.**

1. **Strategy to Use GPT**  
   I learned a strategic approach to using GPT through the resource available at [this link](https://chatgpt.com/c/67036b08-df6c-800d-adf3-8218eb9456fe). I first ask GPT to identify the relevant file and specific part that I need. I then concentrate on precisely what I want to accomplish with the identified content. I found this method immensely helpful in effectively managing my research and programming tasks. This structured approach allowed me to leverage GPT’s capabilities more efficiently, ensuring that I focus on my objectives while minimizing unnecessary diversions.

2. **Good Intro to the New Model**    
   I watched a YouTube video as an introduction to the new GPT model, available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQacCB9tDaw), which was published just four months ago. I found this resource valuable in understanding the fundamental advancements made in the new model. I appreciated how the video succinctly explained the model's capabilities and potential applications. This introduction enhanced my foundational knowledge and set the stage for more advanced exploration of GPT’s functionalities. The insights gained from this video were crucial in shaping my subsequent use and experimentation with GPT technology.
