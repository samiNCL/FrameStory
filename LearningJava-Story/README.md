## Story:

- I utilized the official Java website (https://www.java.com/en/) primarily to download the Java compiler. I found this resource straightforward and essential for setting up the foundational tools I needed to begin programming in Java.

- I referred to the Wikipedia page on Java (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) to understand the historical context and basic principles behind the language. While the information was informative, I realized it did not provide the practical examples I required to help me understand the implementation better.

- I turned to W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/java/) for a more hands-on learning experience. I appreciated the step-by-step tutorials and practical examples that allowed me to write and execute Java code directly within my learning process. This resource significantly facilitated my understanding.

- I focused specifically on the W3Schools page about Java constructors (https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_constructors.asp). Recognizing the importance of constructors, I took my time to understand and apply the examples provided. This was a critical component of my learning journey, and I noted the need to revisit this topic as I delved deeper into Java programming.

- I revisited the same W3Schools page on Java constructors (https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_constructors.asp) multiple times. Each visit reinforced my understanding and underscored the importance of constructors in Java. I acknowledged that understanding constructors was crucial for advancing my skills in object-oriented programming within Java.
