**Reflection**: Metacognition - A brief overview
Metacognition is the knowledge and control of one's own cognitive processes.
The term "metacognition" was first coined by John Flavell in the 1970s.
A literal translation of the term metacognition is 'above thinking' or 'over cognition' or 'higher thinking', all of which denote the intellectual overview gained by observing one's own cognitive processes.
A more meaningful translation of the term is 'thinking about thinking' or 'learning about learning'.
So metacognitive knowledge is knowledge about cognitive processes, such as learning, attention, memory, and problem-solving.
Metacognitive experiences or regulation is the ability to use metacognitive knowledge to control one's cognitive processes.
When applied to learning the term self-regulated learning is used to decribe the ability to use metacognitive knowledge to control and develop our learning processes.
Metacognition is a higher order thinking skill since it involves analysis and evaluation of the learning processes we observe before we create a plan of action to address anything we wish to improve.
It includes the ability to:
Know one's own strengths and weaknesses as a learner.
Identify the learning goals of a task.
Plan and select appropriate strategies for completing a task.
Monitor one's progress and adjust strategies as needed.
Evaluate one's performance and make changes to improve.
By developing metacognitive skills, students can become more aware of their own learning process and take steps to improve their performance.
Metacognition is important for all learners, but it is particularly important for students who wish to develop a greater sense of their own academic, disciplinary or professional practice.
Reflect on our experiences, abilities and understanding of ourselves as practitioners.
