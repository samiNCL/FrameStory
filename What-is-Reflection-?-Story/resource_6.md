**Reflection**: Metacognition & Self-regulation in Education
Welcome to the world of transformative education, where the journey towards success begins with two powerful concepts: metacognition and self-regulation. Here, we introduce you to these game-changing ideas and how they can revolutionise your teaching approach.

Since 2004, Thinking Matters has helped schools create a culture where self-regulation and metacognition is highly valued and where teachers nurture metacognitive learners. It is our belief that in these Thinking Schools students will be armed with the minds and mindsets to succeed in a fast changing future. 


Metacognition
Metacognitive learners are able to regulate their own approach to learning, are able to evaluate different learning strategies and choose the most effective ones for a particular task. By understanding their strengths and weaknesses, students can select appropriate approaches to problem-solving, information processing, and knowledge retention. This enhances a learner’s ability to think critically, to evaluate evidence, and generate solutions to complex problems and promotes deeper understanding and higher-order thinking skills.

At Thinking Matters we feel it is too narrow to confine metacognition to reflecting only on our thinking processes. We believe that being metacognitive of our learning behaviours and dispositions also fall under the ‘meta’ umbrella, as well as an understanding of what drives our skills, knowledge and behaviour – our motives.

There are numerous studies showing the positive impact of metacognition on academic progress. The highly respected EEF, has recently shown it to be amongst the most powerful and cost effective of interventions, one that adds an additional seven months to learner progress. That translates to an accelerated progress beyond predicted scores. If routinely practiced at a whole school level, this maximises the opportunity for students to rehearse and apply strategies in a wide variety of disciplines with increasing confidence and independence.
