**Reflection**: the conscious examination of past experiences, thoughts, and ways of doing things.  Its goal is to surface learning about oneself and the situation, and to bring meaning to it in order to inform the present and the future.  It challenges the status quo of practice, thoughts, and assumptions and may therefore inform our decisions, actions, attitudes, beliefs, and understanding about ourselves.

 

Reflection can be used for many things including:

Allowing us to improve our own practice to gain better outcomes in the future
Increasing/improving our performance and skills
Increasing our awareness of our abilities and attributes and our evidence for these
Developing and expanding our employability
Evaluating the quality and success of our action plans
Applying theoretical knowledge/frameworks to real experiences and using this to expand our understanding of the underlying theory.
