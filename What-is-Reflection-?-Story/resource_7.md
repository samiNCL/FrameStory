**Reflection**: Metacognition
 is the use of reflective awareness to make timely adjustments (self-regulation) to behaviors that support a goal-directed process (e.g. learning, teaching, driving, cooking, writing).

Through metacognition, one should become better able to accurately judge oneâ€™s progress, and select and engage in strategies that will lead to success.
