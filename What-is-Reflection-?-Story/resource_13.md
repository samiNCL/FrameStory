# 6 Tools to support reflective learning
There are different tools and methods for reflective learning. Common tools include:

learning journals, diaries, log books and personal blogs – your thoughts in written prose
lists, bullet points, tables – your thoughts summarised in note form
audiovisual recordings – documenting your voice or using video recordings
visual representations – mind maps, diagrams, sketches.
Journals and learning diaries require you to write weekly entries, and you can base your reflection on course content. A log book (or a ‘lab’ book) is often used in disciplines based on experimental work, such as science. A log gives you an accurate record of a process and helps you to reflect on past actions and make better decisions for future actions. Reflective notes are often used in law, and encourage you to think about your personal reaction to legal issues that have been raised. Other methods of reflection include peer review, which involves students sharing their work with peers for feedback, and self-assessment, which requires you to comment on your own work. We will focus here on two methods that are frequently used to support reflective learning: learning journals and mind maps.

Reflecting on experience
The CARL framework of reflection
The CARL framework of reflection
This framework takes you through Context, Action, Results, and Learning.

Overview
The CARL model is adapted from a job interview technique where you structure each of your answers according to the different aspect of the model. Given the reflective nature of successfully answering many job interview questions, this model can easily be used in general to guide your reflective process on experiences. CARL stands for:

Context: Briefly describe the context of you experience
Action: Explain what actions you took
Results: Explain what happened as a result of your actions
Learning: Identify what you have learned
 

One thing to be conscious of with this model is that it is possible to work through the stages while only describing at each level. Be sure you stop and ask yourself how and why the things happened – this will help move it from descriptions to reflections.

Below is further information on the model – each stage is given a fuller description, guiding questions to ask yourself and a couple of examples of how this might look in a reflection.

This is just one model of reflection. Test it out and see how it works for you. If you find that only a few of the questions are helpful, focus on those. If you think about each area you are likely to engage more critically with your learning experience.

The model

The CARL framework of reflection
This model, unlike a fair amount of other reflection models, does not explicitly require further planned actions. This is not essential for reflection, as identifying new learning is an extremely valuable process and will in many cases affect practice on its own. The model is frequently seen in interviews without the ‘learning’ stage, however it is important to include this stage in reflection as it allows you to critically extract knowledge and learning from the situation.

One potential challenge with using this model is that it encourages you to describe throughout - that is describe the context, the actions, and results and only think about implications in learning. While there can be benefits from solely describing as it can make you aware of the consequences of your actions, describing is not the same as being critically reflective. To ensure that you remain reflective throughout, keep asking yourself the question why – ‘why did I do what I did?’ etc.

For other models there is a natural place where you introduce and think about relevant theoretical literature. In this model each step can benefit from literature, as it can help explain your motivations, for example in actions you might want to use a particular theory to explain why you chose a specific action above another.

A number of helpful questions are outlined below for each of the sections. You don’t have to answer all of them, but they can guide you to what sort of things make sense to include in that section. You might have others questions that work better for you.

 

Context
Here you will set the context for yourself or the reader. Describe what is essential to understand the situation.

Helpful questions:

What was the context of the situation?
What was the situation?
Where was it?
Who was there?
What am I hoping to accomplish?
 

Depending on whether you are presenting the reflection, for example as an interview answer, or using the model as a helpful framework for your own reflective process, you may wish to tailor how extensive you are. If doing it for yourself, it can be very helpful to understand a full comprehensive context, whereas when presenting it to others you may wish to only include enough that the audience understand the context.

Examples of Context
The examples below show how the reflective process can happen at an overarching process level and a specific experience level. Both will tackle the same scenario, but their conclusions can be different. When reflecting both levels can be helpful.

Developing public speaking as a skill over time	Public speaking individual experience
I am currently working on improving my public speaking as a part of my ongoing professional development. I could specifically take opportunities within my role as class representative, where I will have to stand in front of an entire course.	I was given the opportunity to give a presentation about my subject to high school students who might be interested in applying to study it. I had 20 minutes and could spend them as I wished. There were 30 students present in the auditorium at the high school where I gave my talk.
 

Action
Here you can describe what your actions were in relation to the context specified above. To critically engage with the reflection it is important not only to describe your actions, but think about why you did these actions and not something else.

Helpful questions:

What did I do?
What else happened (other actions)?
Why did I choose this action?
What other actions could I have chosen? (not necessarily giving you the same result)
Examples of Action
Developing public speaking as a skill over time	Public speaking individual experience
Within the class representative network I was made aware of an opportunity to go and present our course to high school students who might be interested in taking the course. I signed up despite being slightly time pressured, as I wanted to give myself the chance to practise. I prepared the presentation and the public speaking part went well, however I feel that I might have structured my presentation poorly for the students to gain the most from it.	I chose to do a PowerPoint presentation with a lot of practical information on it. It wasn’t a particularly nice PowerPoint, I generally don’t like them with a lot of text, but I didn’t prioritise the preparation enough so I needed to create something quickly. I could have spent more time actually making a nicer PowerPoint communicating the value of my course more than the practical aspects.
 

Results
Here you can discuss the results that came from your actions and what the implications are of the results.

Helpful questions:

Did I accomplish what I wanted?
Did my actions accomplish what I wanted in the way I expected?
What are the implications of my actions on myself/others/similar situations in the future?
Could different actions have given me the same result?
Is there a way I could improve my results or actions?
Examples of Results
Developing public speaking as a skill over time	Public speaking individual experience
I gave myself a chance to practise my public speaking and I am feeling more comfortable standing in front of a group of people now, just because I have practised. As mentioned above, I could have structured the presentation differently. Having a well-structured presentation would have given me the same feeling of success in terms of public speaking and had a better impact on the students. However, from this experience I now know I can spend less time stressing about the public speaking element of it, and spend more time on the actual presentation.	I could see that the students were desperately trying to write down everything I said and what was on the slides. However I felt confident in my delivery of the content, I didn’t feel a loss of breath or anything, which suggests I’m feeling more confident with public speaking itself. That said, I didn’t feel like they were actually getting any value from the presentation. They didn’t seem excited, and no one asked questions or anything. I think they would have gotten more from why they should study this course, rather than how to apply. I think equally if I had allowed times for their questions they would have gotten much more value from the situation.
 

Learning
Here you have a chance to conclude using the insights gained from the three sections above. While not explicitly suggested by the model, if you want to include an action plan this is a natural place to do so.

Helpful questions:

What did I learn from the experience?
Would I do the same thing again or would I change something?
What should I do next time I’m in a similar experience?
Should I change anything about the way I do things? What?
Examples of Learning
Developing public speaking as a skill over time	Public speaking individual experience
I have learned that I get better at public speaking when I give myself the opportunity to practise in front of people. I will therefore continue to seek out challenges including public speaking. However, I have also realised that while I get similar benefit to my own development in term of confidence through standing in front of others, I can practise the most effective way of delivering the content. In the future I have to give myself more time to prepare.

I have realised if I had spent more time thinking about what information the students needed and how to present it, it would have been a more impactful experience. The way I presented is an example of passive learning (people just sitting and receiving information) which has been shown to be less effective than active learning (people participating in the activity; e.g. Michel et al, 2009) Therefore, I think using group participation and allowing them to guide the discussion by asking questions and following their interests would have been better. I will ensure I incorporate interactive activities in my future presentations.

I was going through my old files a few days ago when I saw my article on self-reflection. I asked myself, “Ama, why didn’t you go back to write the article on self-reflective tools that you promised your colleagues?”. Unfortunately, I was guilty with no explanation. Let’s just say that I took a good look at myself in the mirror and realized that I had to step up my game! To help me get back on track, I’d like us to take a brief look at what we discussed in the first article.

In the previous article, we discussed self-reflection and the benefits of practicing self-reflection as a learning and development professional.  We will build on that foundation now by looking at some common tools for practicing self-reflection.

These tools include:

Self-talk
Reflective learning journals
Reflective writing exercises
Incident analyses or critical reflections
Lesson evaluations
Observations
Learner dialogues
I have decided to chunk this section on self-reflection tools into four (4) articles. This segmentation will allow us to keep each write-up brief and easily readable while simultaneously enabling us to give ample attention to each tool. In this article, I would like to focus on self-talk and reflective & learning journals. I hope you have prepared yourself a good cup of tea or coffee; if you have, relax, and find yourself a quiet place as we start with Self-Talk.

Self-Talk

I love self-talk, I do it all the time.  When I engage in self-talk, I shed my professional mask and I forgo the name Margaret completely, instead, I am Ama. Ama is a Ghanaian-Akan name given to girls born on Saturday like I was, and Ama reflects my most intimate self. She is a treasure beyond compare and I love talking to her; when we talk, it helps me to consider my ways of thinking. Sometimes when I am reading an article or manual or watching a YouTube video (the list could go on and on) I ask Ama “what do we find confusing?”, and “do we know this?”  Throughout my life, Ama has been my main woman.

As a learning and development professional hearing yourself talk out loud can be a great way to self-reflect.   It is said that speaking to yourself out loud helps you to slow down your thoughts and process them differently because you are engaging the language centers of your brain.

 When you engage in self-explaining it unleashes impulses of curiosity that may otherwise remain unexplored. It causes you to ask the question, “Why?”. If you are knowledgeable about a topic, you realize that the “why” questions are easy but when you are a little less familiar with a certain subject matter, the “why” questions become very difficult. However, not knowing all the answers provides you with a beautiful opportunity to develop a new area of expertise.

Below are some pros and cons of self-talk (self-explaining), that I think you may find helpful.

Pros

Helps you to slow down your thoughts and process them differently. For example, you may:

see new links and associations   
unleash impulses of creativity that may otherwise remain unexplored
challenge your thoughts
put your thoughts into a better perspective

ERA Cycle
ERA CycleThe ERA cycle (Jasper, 2013) is one of the most simple models of reflection and contains only three stages:

Experience
Reflection 
Action
The cycle shows that we will start with an experience, either something we have been through before or something completely new to us. This experience can be positive or negative and may be related to our work or something else. Once something has been experienced we will start to reflect on what happened. This will allow us to think through the experience, examine our feelings about what happened and decide on the next steps. This leads to the final element of the cycle - taking an action. What we do as a result of an experience will be different depending on the individual. This action will result in another experience and the cycle will continue. 

Jasper, M. (2013). Beginning Reflective Practice. Andover: Cengage Learning.

Driscoll's What Model
Driscoll's What ModelAnother simple model was developed by Driscoll in the mid-1990s. Driscoll based his model of the 3 What's on the key questions asked by Terry Borton in the 1970s:

What?
So what?
Now what?
By asking ourselves these three simple questions we can begin to analyse and learn from our experiences. Firstly we should describe what the situation or experience was to set it in context. This gives us a clear idea of what we are dealing with. We should then reflect on the experience by asking 'so what?' - what did we learn as a result of the experience? The final stage asks us to think about the action we will take as a result of this reflection. Will we change a behavior, try something new or carry on as we are? It is important to remember that there may be no changes as the result of reflection and that we feel that we are doing everything as we should. This is equally valid as an outcome and you should not worry if you can't think of something to change.

Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle
Kol's Experiential Learning CycleKolb's model (1984) takes things a step further. Based on theories about how people learn, this model centres on the concept of developing understanding through actual experiences and contains four key stages:

Concrete experience
Reflective observation
Abstract conceptualization
Active experimentation 
The model argues that we start with an experience - either a repeat of something that has happened before or something completely new to us. The next stage involves us reflecting on the experience and noting anything about it which we haven't come across before. We then start to develop new ideas as a result, for example when something unexpected has happened we try to work out why this might be. The final stage involves us applying our new ideas to different situations. This demonstrates learning as a direct result of our experiences and reflections. This model is similar to one used by small children when learning basic concepts such as hot and cold. They may touch something hot, be burned and be more cautious about touching something which could potentially hurt them in the future.

Reflective tools enable reflection and concentration on many things: our relationships, our careers, a specific situation and our decisions, to name a few.

In current times, we need to take time to properly reflect. The world and our careers are changing so fast and can often feel stressful, it is even more important at the moment to take this time to reflect and learn from the change we are experiencing so that we can build resilience and move forward with confidence.

 

What is reflective practice?
 

Reflective practice is something that encourages us to take time to focus on a situation, concentrating on our feelings and analysing the experience by identifying what was good/bad about it and what we can do differently if it were to happen again. It is usually written down or spoken about, something we can refer back to and recognise patterns of change and development; it usually becomes habitual.

Reflective practice is creating a space to allow us to learn from our experiences, and think about what did happen, and what we could or should do differently in the future. Building up this store of information and experience within us, builds confidence and resilience in facing future challenges

 

As described by CIPD, reflective practice is 

“foundation of professional development; it makes meaning from experience and

transforms insights into practical strategies for personal growth and organisational impact.”

 

It is:

Learning to pay attention – listening to ourselves
Coming face to face with our assumptions
Noticing patterns
Changing what we see
Changing the way we see
Learning from our experiences.
Reflective practice is, in its simplest form, thinking about or reflecting on what you do. It’s a really important part of learning from experience. Studies have shown that experience does not necessarily lead to learning unless you have taken time to think about the experience.
 Thinking about the past is part of being human; however, the difference between casual ‘thinking’ and ‘reflective practice’ is that reflective practice requires a conscious effort to think about events, and develop insights. You can then use that information to add to your existing knowledge base and reach a higher level of understanding.
Within an apprenticeship, the development of reflective skills is an essential element of the programme, helping you to develop more effectively your skills and behaviours in the workplace. Reflection also forms a core part of your Endpoint Assessment. There are many different reflective models and tools you can use to help develop your reflection skills. 
Your reflection can easily become a box-ticking exercise, something we have to do. If this is the case for you, then you are missing a valuable step in your development.  
Consider using a different reflective model, one that helps you to reflect enjoyably and constructively. You may also consider using something other than a word or excel document to reflect with. Many people use online reflection tools, blogs, podcasts and other 21st Century tools to help them to reflect.
There is a range of resources attached to this page to help you to start thinking about reflection, these will help give you some context around the value of reflection and introduce you to a range of different reflective models.

Managing Yourself
Why You Should Make Time for Self-Reflection (Even If You Hate Doing It)
by Jennifer Porter
March 21, 2017
Summary.   Research has shown that reflection boosts productivity. Yet few leaders make time for it. Why? For one, they often don’t know where to start. You can become more reflective by practicing a few simple steps. Start by identifying a few important questions. Some...more

When people find out I’m an executive coach, they often ask who my toughest clients are. Inexperienced leaders? Senior leaders who think they know everything? Leaders who bully and belittle others? Leaders who shirk responsibility?

The answer is none of the above. The hardest leaders to coach are those who won’t reflect — particularly leaders who won’t reflect on themselves.

At its simplest, reflection is about careful thought. But the kind of reflection that is really valuable to leaders is more nuanced than that. The most useful reflection involves the conscious consideration and analysis of beliefs and actions for the purpose of learning. Reflection gives the brain an opportunity to pause amidst the chaos, untangle and sort through observations and experiences, consider multiple possible interpretations, and create meaning. This meaning becomes learning, which can then inform future mindsets and actions. For leaders, this “meaning making” is crucial to their ongoing growth and development.

Research by Giada Di Stefano, Francesca Gino, Gary Pisano, and Bradley Staats in call centers demonstrated that employees who spent 15 minutes at the end of the day reflecting about lessons learned performed 23% better after 10 days than those who did not reflect. A study of UK commuters found a similar result when those who were prompted to use their commute to think about and plan for their day were happier, more productive, and less burned out than people who didn’t.

So, if reflection is so helpful, why don’t many leaders do it?  Leaders often:

Don’t understand the process.  Many leaders don’t know how to reflect. One executive I work with, Ken, shared recently that he had yet again not met his commitment to spend an hour on Sunday mornings reflecting. To help him get over this barrier, I suggested he take the next 30 minutes of our two-hour session and just quietly reflect and then we’d debrief it. After five minutes of silence, he said, “I guess I don’t really know what you want me to do. Maybe that’s why I haven’t been doing it.”
Don’t like the process. Reflection requires leaders to do a number of things they typically don’t like to do: slow down, adopt a mindset of not knowing and curiosity, tolerate messiness and inefficiency, and take personal responsibility. The process can lead to valuable insights and even breakthroughs — and it can also lead to feelings of discomfort, vulnerability, defensiveness, and irritation.
Don’t like the results. When a leader takes time to reflect, she typically sees ways she was effective as well as things she could have done better. Most leaders quickly dismiss the noted strengths and dislike the noted weaknesses. Some become so defensive in the process that they don’t learn anything, so the results are not helpful.
Have a bias towards action. Like soccer goalies, many leaders have a bias toward action. A study of professional soccer goalies defending penalty kicks found that goalies who stay in the center of the goal, instead of lunging left or right, have a 33% chance of stopping the goal, and yet these goalies only stay in the center 6% of the time. The goalies just feel better when they “do something.”  The same is true of many leaders. Reflection can feel like staying in the center of the goal and missing the action.
Can’t see a good ROI.  From early roles, leaders are taught to invest where they can generate a positive ROI — results that indicate the contribution of time, talent or money paid off.  Sometimes it’s hard to see an immediate ROI on reflection — particularly when compared with other uses of a leader’s time.
If you have found yourself making these same excuses, you can become more reflective by practicing a few simple steps.

Identify some important questions. But don’t answer them yet. Here are some possibilities:
What are you avoiding?
How are you helping your colleagues achieve their goals?
How are you not helping or even hindering their progress?
How might you be contributing to your least enjoyable relationship at work?
How could you have been more effective in a recent meeting?
Select a reflection process that matches your preferences.  Many people reflect through writing in a journal.  If that sounds terrible but talking with a colleague sounds better, consider that.  As long as you’re reflecting and not just chatting about the latest sporting event or complaining about a colleague, your approach is up to you.  You can sit, walk, bike, or stand, alone or with a partner, writing, talking, or thinking.
Schedule time.  Most leaders are driven by their calendars. So, schedule your reflection time and then commit to keep it. And if you find yourself trying to skip it or avoid it, reflect on that!
Start small.  If an hour of reflection seems like too much, try 10 minutes.  Teresa Amabile and her colleagues found that the most significant driver of positive emotions and motivation at work was making progress on the tasks at hand. Set yourself up to make progress, even if it feels small.
Do it. Go back to your list of questions and explore them. Be still. Think. Consider multiple perspectives. Look at the opposite of what you initially believe. Brainstorm. You don’t have to like or agree with all of your thoughts — just think and to examine your thinking.
Ask for help. For most leaders, a lack of desire, time, experience, or skill can get in the way of reflection.  Consider working with a colleague, therapist, or coach to help you make the time, listen carefully, be a thought partner, and hold you accountable.
Despite the challenges to reflection, the impact is clear. As Peter Drucker said: “Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection, will come even more effective action.”

Gibbs' Reflective Cycle
Gibbs' Reflective Cycle
One of the most famous cyclical models of reflection leading you through six stages exploring an experience: description, feelings, evaluation, analysis, conclusion and action plan.

Overview
Gibbs' Reflective Cycle was developed by Graham Gibbs in 1988 to give structure to learning from experiences.  It offers a framework for examining experiences, and given its cyclic nature lends itself particularly well to repeated experiences, allowing you to learn and plan from things that either went well or didn’t go well. It covers 6 stages:

Description of the experience
Feelings and thoughts about the experience
Evaluation of the experience, both good and bad
Analysis to make sense of the situation
Conclusion about what you learned and what you could have done differently
Action plan for how you would deal with similar situations in the future, or general changes you might find appropriate.
 

Below is further information on:

The model – each stage is given a fuller description, guiding questions to ask yourself and an example of how this might look in a reflection
Different depths of reflection – an example of reflecting more briefly using this model
 

This is just one model of reflection. Test it out and see how it works for you. If you find that only a few of the questions are helpful for you, focus on those. However, by thinking about each stage you are more likely to engage critically with your learning experience.

The model

Gibbs' reflective cycle
This model is a good way to work through an experience. This can be either a stand-alone experience or a situation you go through frequently, for example meetings with a team you have to collaborate with. Gibbs originally advocated its use in repeated situations, but the stages and principles apply equally well for single experiences too. If done with a stand-alone experience, the action plan may become more general and look at how you can apply your conclusions in the future.

 

For each of the stages of the model a number of helpful questions are outlined below. You don’t have to answer all of them but they can guide you about what sort of things make sense to include in that stage. You might have other prompts that work better for you.

 

Description
Here you have a chance to describe the situation in detail. The main points to include here concern what happened. Your feelings and conclusions will come later.

Helpful questions:

What happened?
When and where did it happen?
Who was present?
What did you and the other people do?
What was the outcome of the situation?
Why were you there?
What did you want to happen?
Example of 'Description'
Group work assignment
For an assessed written group-work assignment, my group (3 others from my course) and I decided to divide the different sections between us so that we only had to research one element each. We expected we could just piece the assignment together in the afternoon the day before the deadline, meaning that we didn’t have to schedule time to sit and write it together. However, when we sat down it was clear the sections weren’t written in the same writing style. We therefore had to rewrite most of the assignment to make it a coherent piece of work.  We had given ourselves enough time before the deadline to individually write our own sections, however we did not plan a great deal of time to rewrite if something were to go wrong. Therefore, two members of the group had to drop their plans that evening so the assignment would be finished in time for the deadline.

Here you can explore any feelings or thoughts that you had during the experience and how they may have impacted the experience.

Helpful questions:

What were you feeling during the situation?
What were you feeling before and after the situation?
What do you think other people were feeling about the situation?
What do you think other people feel about the situation now?
What were you thinking during the situation?
What do you think about the situation now?
Example of 'Feelings'
Group work assignment
Before we came together and realised we still had a lot of work to do, I was quite happy and thought we had been smart when we divided the work between us. When we realised we couldn’t hand in the assignment like it was, I got quite frustrated. I was certain it was going to work, and therefore I had little motivation to actually do the rewriting. Given that a couple of people from the group had to cancel their plans I ended up feeling quite guilty, which actually helped me to work harder in the evening and get the work done faster. Looking back, I’m feeling satisfied that we decided to put in the work.
 

Evaluation
Here you have a chance to evaluate what worked and what didn’t work in the situation. Try to be as objective and honest as possible. To get the most out of your reflection focus on both the positive and the negative aspects of the situation, even if it was primarily one or the other.

Helpful questions:

What was good and bad about the experience?
What went well?
What didn’t go so well?
What did you and other people contribute to the situation (positively or negatively)?
Example of 'Evaluation'
Group work assignment
The things that were good and worked well was the fact that each group member produced good quality work for the agreed deadline. Moreover, the fact that two people from the group cancelled plans motivated us to work harder in the evening. That contributed positively to the group’s work ethic. The things that clearly didn’t work was that we assumed we wrote in the same way, and therefore the overall time plan of the group failed.
 

Analysis
The analysis step is where you have a chance to make sense of what happened. Up until now you have focused on details around what happened in the situation. Now you have a chance to extract meaning from it. You want to target the different aspects that went well or poorly and ask yourself why. If you are looking to include academic literature, this is the natural place to include it.

Helpful questions:

Why did things go well?
Why didn’t it go well?
What sense can I make of the situation?
What knowledge – my own or others (for example academic literature) can help me understand the situation?
Example of 'Analysis'
Group work assignment
I think the reason that our initial division of work went well was because each person had a say in what part of the assignment they wanted to work on, and we divided according to people’s self-identified strengths. I have experienced working this way before and discovered when I’m working by myself I enjoy working in areas that match my strengths. It seems natural to me that this is also the case in groups.

I think we thought that this approach would save us time when piecing together the sections in the end, and therefore we didn’t think it through. In reality, it ended up costing us far more time than expected and we also had to stress and rush through the rewrite.  I think the fact we hadn’t planned how we were writing and structuring the sections led us to this situation.

I searched through some literature on group work and found two things that help me understand the situation. Belbin’s (e.g. 2010) team roles suggests that each person has certain strengths and weaknesses they bring to a group. While we didn’t think about our team members in the same way Belbin does, effective team work and work delegation seems to come from using people’s different strengths, which we did.

Another theory that might help explain why we didn’t predict the plan wouldn’t work is ‘Groupthink’ (e.g. Janis, 1991). Groupthink is where people in a group won’t raise different opinions to a dominant opinion or decision, because they don’t want to seem like an outsider. I think if we had challenged our assumptions about our plan - by actually being critical, we would probably have foreseen that it wouldn’t work. Some characteristics of groupthink that were in our group were: ‘collective rationalisation’ – we kept telling each other that it would work; and probably ‘illusion of invulnerability’ – we are all good students, so of course we couldn’t do anything wrong.

I think being aware of groupthink in the future will be helpful in group work, when trying to make decisions.

 

Conclusions
In this section you can make conclusions about what happened. This is where you summarise your learning and highlight what changes to your actions could improve the outcome in the future. It should be a natural response to the previous sections.

Helpful questions:

What did I learn from this situation?
How could this have been a more positive situation for everyone involved?
What skills do I need to develop for me to handle a situation like this better?
What else could I have done?
Example of a 'Conclusion'
Group work assignment
I learned that when a group wants to divide work, we must plan how we want each section to look and feel – having done this would likely have made it possible to put the sections together and submit without much or any rewriting. Moreover, I will continue to have people self-identify their strengths and possibly even suggest using the ‘Belbin team roles’-framework with longer projects. Lastly, I learned that we sometimes have to challenge the decisions we seem to agree on in the group to ensure that we are not agreeing just because of groupthink.
 

Action plan
At this step you plan for what you would do differently in a similar or related situation in the future. It can also be extremely helpful to think about how you will help yourself to act differently – such that you don’t only plan what you will do differently, but also how you will make sure it happens. Sometimes just the realisation is enough, but other times reminders might be helpful.

Helpful questions:

If I had to do the same thing again, what would I do differently?
How will I develop the required skills I need?
How can I make sure that I can act differently next time?
Example of 'Action Plan'
Group work assignment
When I’m working with a group next time, I will talk to them about what strengths they have. This is easy to do and remember in a first meeting, and also potentially works as an ice-breaker if we don’t know each other well. Next, if we decide to divide work, I will insist that we plan out what we expect from it beforehand. Potentially I would suggest writing the introduction or first section together first, so that we have a reference for when we are writing our own parts. I’m confident this current experience will be enough to remind me to suggest this if anyone says we should divide up the work in the future. Lastly, I will ask if we can challenge our initial decisions so that we are confident we are making informed decisions to avoid groupthink. If I have any concerns, I will tell the group. I think by remembering I want the best result possible will make me be able to disagree even when it feels uncomfortable.
 

Different depths of reflection
Depending on the context you are doing the reflection in, you might want use different levels of details. Here is the same scenario, which was used in the example above, however it is presented much more briefly.

Short example of Gibbs’ reflective cycle:

Describe:

In a group work assignment, we divided sections according to people’s strengths. When we tried to piece the assignment together it was written in different styles and therefore we had to spend time rewriting it.

 Feelings:

I thought our plan would work and felt good about it. When we had to rewrite it, I felt frustrated.

Evaluation:

The process of dividing sections went well. However, it didn’t work not having foreseen/planned rewriting the sections for coherence and writing styles.

Analysis:

Dividing work according to individual strengths is useful. Belbin’s team roles (2010) would suggest something similar. I have done it before and it seems to work well.

The reason piecing work together didn’t work was we had no plan for what it needed to look like. We were so focused on finishing quickly that no one would raise a concern. The last part can be explained by ‘groupthink’ (e.g. Jarvis, 1991), where members of a group make a suboptimal decision because individuals are afraid of challenging the consensus.

Conclusion:

I learned that using people’s strengths is efficient. Moreover, planning how we want the work to look, before we go off on our own is helpful. Lastly, I will remember the dangers of groupthink, and what the theory suggests to look out for.

Action plan:

I will use Belbin’s team roles to divide group work in the future. Moreover, I will suggest writing one section together before we do our own work, so we can mirror that in our own writing. Finally, I will speak my mind when I have concerns, by remembering it can benefit the outcome.
