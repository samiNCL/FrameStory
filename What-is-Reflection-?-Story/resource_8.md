**Reflection**: Reading With Metacognition
The importance of metacognitive reading strategies
Your child will not do well in college unless he can read with metacognition. It’s the final step in reading proficiency and the ultimate reading skill. It’s what separates excellent readers from mediocre readers. And it is the difference between average grades and excellent grades.

However, getting to reading with metacognition is a long journey. It’s takes years to master. Here we discuss what metacognition is and what it takes to read with metacognition.

What Is Metacognition in Reading?
The simplest definitions of metacognition are “thinking about one’s thinking” or “knowing about knowing.” Metacognition refers to the process of considering and regulating one’s own learning. In reading this means the reader can think critically about her own understanding as she goes. She is aware of her own cognitive experience.

The keys are knowing about knowing and then doing something about that knowledge. A metacognition example is when reading a text asking yourself am I understanding this or should I go back and read prior paragraphs or chapters so this will make more sense?  The first part is knowledge of cognition. The second part, is regulation of cognition to maximize learning. Metacognition refers to both.

Deep Understanding
A key aspect of reading comprehension is deep understanding. Deep understanding goes beyond literal comprehension and factual knowledge. It’s about putting information in context, connecting it to prior knowledge, interpreting, analyzing and contrasting it to previously held understanding with a view to revising that understanding.

The key point about deep understanding is that once you truly and deeply understand something, you are in position to do something positive with that understanding. Things like:

create or design
generalize or reflect
theorize or hypothesize
criticize or think critically about its implications
distill to promote better understanding for others
Of course, deep understanding is a major career and life skill, particularly in todays knowledge economy.  It takes deep understanding to make improvements or recommend a change of course. Deep understanding requires metacognition.
