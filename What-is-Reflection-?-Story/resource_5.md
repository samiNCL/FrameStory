Abstract
A famous learning paradox is that people without experience of designing do not understand teachersâ€™ words about what design is. In order to understand it well, there is no other way than embarking on designing in spite of a lack of that understanding and absorbing the true meaning of finding cues and variables, framing a problem, solving it and re-finding something new that was unexpected in the previous problem-framing. Then, all we reserachers and design teachers could or should do is to motivate students to dare to embark on designing. One promising way to motivate them is to provide stories on meta-cognitive processes from the perspective of internal observation. The present paper claims that metacognition serves as an effective tool to drive the process of exploration through finding cues, framing a problem and externalizing a solution and thereby to provide stories from the view of internal observation.
